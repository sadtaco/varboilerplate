# varboilerplate
CSS boilerplate using CSS vars, rem scaling, and built on top of normalize.css

I wanted a simple CSS boilerplate which...
* has easy theming with CSS vars. I can find this on Barebones.
* Most/all units are rem.  I can find this on milligram and wingcss
* Not vomit on the CSS inspector, to ease debugging and overrides
* Is lightweight. Basically just a boilerplate, and CSS only.

I couldn't find anything that meets all 4 of those points, so I'm making this.
